# Static site for documentation

## If you are looking for our documentation please refer to https://documentation.theeye.io

## What is this repo?
A static web page (sometimes called a flat page or a stationary page) is a web page that is delivered to the user's web browser exactly as stored,[1] in contrast to dynamic web pages which are generated by a web application.[2]

Consequently, a static web page displays the same information for all users, from all contexts, subject to modern capabilities of a web server to negotiate content-type or language of the document where such versions are available and the server is configured to do so.

## Made with Docsify.js
